           <p>Environmental education should be taught by a multitude of people, and representation through diversity initiatives is important to education. Diverse populations should be taught by diverse educators, because emulation is a huge part of learning. It has been long known that there is a great disparity in the demographics that are seen at the head of the environmental education movement. <br />
               <br />
               Despite this supposed disparity, not much data was actually recorded on the demographics involved in the environmental education industry at large outside of the major organizations, so Rupanwita Gupta, John Fraser, Christina Shane-Simpson, Sharon Danoff-Burg and Nezam Ardalan (2019) conducted a study that broadened the scope to self-identified environmental educators. Though typically conceived as a very scholarly and formal profession, the questions on this survey asked individuals to report not only whether they identified as an environmental educator, but also whether they were employed in the field and if they had any schooling on the subject in high school or college. The results from this survey were interesting to say the least, as they largely contradicted the disparity seen in the professional organizations.<br />
               <br />
               While the majority of environmental educators in the big organizations were white women (though the leadership was still disproportionately occupied by men), the study showed that ethic minorities were more likely to self-identify as an environmental educator than white individuals. Those who self-identified as environmental educators were more likely to be paid for their position, whether that be through a formal education setting or an informal setting such as a museum or national park. Based off of all of the information they pulled, there were a disproportionate amount of people who identified as environmental educators on a national scale, and more people who claimed to have formal schooling than data from universities would suggest. It was also mentioned that oversampling might have been an issue in the EPA regions they were pulling from, and earlier in their study they were said to have put out a flawed survey, which they then corrected. Because of these procedural errors, and how contradictory the results were to the formal, professional organizations estimates, there should be some skepticism to the legitimacy of this study. Surveys are also an inherently biased form of data collection and analysis, as it is dependent on the assumption that the participant is honest and informed in their response.<br />
               <br />
               Regardless of that, this poses an even greater concern: if there are so many ethnic minorities that identify as environmental educators, why is that not reflected by the most public faces of the industry in the recognized organizations? It’s obviously not a lack of interest that is barring them from entry, given the survey responses. Though maybe education level is the big separator from self-identified and officially affiliated. But even then, there are more environmental educators than there are people with degrees in the field of study, as this data set shows. This study reveals a lot about the interest in the industry, but it doesn’t dismiss the problem of a lack of representation in the field.</p>
