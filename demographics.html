           <p>A lot of that kinda has to do with the coding of museums as a very family oriented space, and so it’s interesting that the museum is trying to push that it is for everyone. It’s somewhere that people can come to by themself and that’s something people often feel barred from. They get the young families, they get the preschools and the moms with toddlers, and they have a lot for them. The museum always caters to young kids first, because that is the primary audience they deal with. The rest of it is geared toward whatever sorta the predominant age group is and so the real challenge is trying to give a presentation for everybody. The question then: how can the museum truly be inclusive to all if that demands that it tailors its teaching to the audience?</p>
