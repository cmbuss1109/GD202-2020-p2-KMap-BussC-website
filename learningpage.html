        <h1>The Intracacies of Learning</h1>
        <h3>How to Educate</h3>
        <p>An important element in determining effective teaching is understanding the needs of the audience. Environmental educators have to understand how to best communicate life science to primarily children. Jickling, B., Blenkinsop, S., Morse, M., and Jensen, A. (2018) explore the expansive project of wild pedagogies, that is to say, the importance of nature and wilderness to teaching and what can be taken from it. This initiative is directed to teach children not just in conjunction with nature, but for the environment to truly be the leading force in the learning process. The wild pedagogies project is broken down by Jickling et al. into six major touchpoints: “1) agency and the role of nature as a co-teacher, 2) wilderness and challenging ideas of control, 3) complexity, the unknown, and spontaneity, 4) cultural change, 5) time and practice, and 6) locating the wild.” In order to teach this way, old habits must be overwritten by these new teachings and that can only come with practice. The role of the teacher is to probe and guide the children’s journeys.</p>
        <h3>Educating Educators</h3>
        <p>Before environmental education can be taught to children, it must first be taught to educators. Nielsen, W., Andersen, P., Hurley, A., Sabljak, V., Petereit, A., Hoskin, V., and Hoban, G. (2012) developed and analysed the effectiveness of a curriculum for pre-service teachers that stressed the importance of environmental education in the classroom. To test the effectiveness of this class, they conducted an anonymous survey on what the students felt they learned, or in some cases, what they didn’t. A number of the pre-service teacher students were skeptical of the class, and didn’t seem to understand the importance of what they were studying. According to their analysis, this was a common trait among students who couldn’t grasp the abstract quality of the teachings and thus seemed less likely to think critically with their programming and teaching. Some of these views shifted when given concrete examples of how to implement environmental education into their teaching curricula, like when a guest speaker came in and talked about the sustainable garden project they did with their primary school students. </p>
        <h3>Learning From Yourself</h3>
        <p>Self awareness and the perception they hold of their role and their initiative is important to an educator. Emily Evans, Cynthia Carter Ching and Heidi L. Ballard (2012) conducted a case study on how volunteer nature guides viewed their role as an environmental educator to the visitors of the nature reserve. The results boiled down to some combination of the same three elements: sharing expertise, facilitating outdoor experiences, and promoting stewardship. For some, sharing expertise was something that made the role feel desirable; for others, the idea that they are expected to be an expert felt limiting and barred them from applying initially. Facilitating outdoor experiences was typically conceived as a positive thing. Stewardship is something clearly valued by the active guides in the study, but forgotten or neglected by the nonactive guides. This results from a more heightened perception of the environment, and how its resources are important to the public. Essentially, the individual’s perceived competence surrounding the obligations they believe they had directly impact how they valued and fulfilled their work.</p>
